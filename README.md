# INTBDO

### General Information
This is an old project made for a popular mmorpg. The purpose was to gain better understanding of reverse engineering x64 applications, runtime hooks, and general asm/c++ usage. This will no longer work as-is on the mmorpg; offsets and structs have largely changed since its inception.

Please check the Wiki for more information on how this program worked.


#### This project is no longer supported.

# BeeDO

### General Information
This is an old project made in 2015 for a popular mmorpg. The purpose was to gain better understanding of reverse engineering x64 applications, hooks, pattern-scanning, and generally asm/c++. This will no longer work as-is and may crash the client.

Thank you to everyone on GH & UC that helped me complete this project!

#### This project is no longer supported.

#### I have decided to make this a learning experience for those that are interested in the project so I will be updating the files over time to describe what is happening and why.

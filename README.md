# BeeDO

### General Information
This is an old project made in 2015 for a popular mmorpg. The purpose was to gain better understanding of reverse engineering x64 applications, hooks, pattern-scanning, and generally asm/c++. This will no longer work as-is and may crash the client.

Functionality: Hooks into target app's memory then reads, writes, and logs player-generated data over time.

Thank you to everyone on GH & UC that helped me complete this project!

#### This project is no longer supported. For those that are interested, please read the comments that I have included inside the code to learn what is happening.

#### As of 2021 - Added descriptive comments on most of program's functionality
